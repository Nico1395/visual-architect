# Visual Architect
I really love software architecture. I love designing it, thinking about it, crunching ideas and proposals to solve problems. But as much as I love software architecture, I just wish the design tools would be a little more integrated and easy-going. Integrated into repositories or project management platforms and easy-going enough, so that even some of the lazier devs on my team would use it and take our software architecture serious.

Mermaid Diagram, Plant UML, draw.io or Excalidraw... they are all great Options for different purposes. Some of them are exclusive to a web app, they all have custom file formats and serialization. Some integrate into some apps, like Azure DevOps or GitHub, while others dont. Its a little bit of a mess, to be honest and thats where I want Visual Architect to clean it all up a little.

I want Visual Architect to be an open-source, self-hostable platform that has all the tools you would need to design and conceptualize software.
