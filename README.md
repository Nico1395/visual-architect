# Visual Architect
I really love software architecture. I love designing it, thinking about it, crunching ideas and proposals to solve problems. But as much as I love software architecture, I just wish the design tools would be a little more integrated and easy-going. Integrated into repositories or project management platforms and easy-going enough, so that even some of the lazier devs on my team would use it and take our software architecture serious.

Mermaid Diagram, Plant UML, draw.io or Excalidraw... they are all great Options for different purposes. Some of them are exclusive to a web app, they all have custom file formats and serialization. Some integrate into some apps, like Azure DevOps or GitHub, while others dont. Its a little bit of a mess, to be honest and thats where I want Visual Architect to clean it all up a little.

I want Visual Architect to be an open-source, self-hostable platform that has all the tools you would need to design and conceptualize software.

## Development Status
- Currently in development
- Heading towards a prototype (pre-0.0.0.1) and aiming for
  - Core functionalities
  - Authentication using OAuth (supporting Microslop, Google, GitHub)
  - Support for a few design types (the type of content used to design a specific software module, i.e. Mermaid, Plant UML, picture, Markdown, Code)
- Planning to develop a few revised prototypes to increase the amount of features step by step, allowing breaking changes before committing to a full on release
- Planning to host the app publicly if the Visual Architect delivers enough value
- No monetization planned as of now, thats a topic for Visual Achitect of version 1.0.0.0
- Not really planning on integrating AI so far
